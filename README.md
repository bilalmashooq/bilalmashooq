 ### Collaboration
💞️ I'm eager to collaborate on projects related to biometrics, computer vision, machine learning, and related fields. Whether it's research initiatives, open-source projects, or innovative applications, I'm keen to contribute and learn from like-minded individuals.

 ### Get in Touch
📫 Feel free to reach out to me through GitHub or via email [muhammadbilalmashooqali@gmail.com] if you'd like to connect, discuss potential collaborations, or simply chat about our shared interests.
